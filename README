This is a text-based multiplayer maze type game implemented as a Telnet server.
It is a completely standalone C program with no dependencies other than some
linux-specific syscalls (like epoll). By default it wants to run on port 23,
which requires root.

To play, type "load levels" in the server. This loads the levels in the file
"levels" that is part of the repository. Then simply connect to the game with
telnet from another terminal. Multiple people can be playing at the same time,
and this is required to get past some of the example levels.
